## Summary
A simplified semi-analytical model of groundwater flow in floodplain aquifers. The code comes in two variants (CLI-Matlab & interactive Python Bokeh).

## Matlab
This version was used to create the respective numbers, figures and tables of the related research article. It contains the classes necessary to construct the simplified models, all functions and scripts used to create the article's figures, as well as a documentation.

## Python
This version of the code aims to provide an interactive way to explore the simplified models. It makes use (and hence requires) Python Bokeh in its "standalone" variant. A running version can be found (as of the time of writing of this text: 2021-06-25) at https://jonasallgeier.github.io/fpsimple.
